This semester project aims to explore various properties and applications of Markov Chains and the algorithms related to them. \\\\
We begin with formal definitions related to Markov chains and its properties. Then various properties of Markov Chains such as the Reducibility and Periodicity associated with Markov chain processes are explored. Further, the existence, convergence and the uniqueness of the stationary distributions  associated with a Markov Chain process are explored. \\
Further the project looks into details ways to simulate the Markov chain using various techniques including Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods such as Gibbs sampling and Metropolis Hasting Methods. The drawbacks associated with these methods and the methods to resolve them using modifications to the algorithms using the Propp-Wilson methods are discussed. With further investigation, the  Propp-Wilson algorithms are further improved as well. We conclude our discussion on algorithms with a technique known as simulated annealing. The project concludes by looking at the Hidden Markov Models and their recent applications in various industries.
